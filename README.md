OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision where the goal is to assign a label or class to an image. This process involves using a pre-trained model or training a new model on a dataset to recognize patterns and features in the images.
Steps in Image Classification:
1.	Data Collection: Gather a dataset of labeled images.
2.	Data Preprocessing: Resize images, normalize pixel values, and possibly augment the data.
3.	Model Selection: Choose a pre-trained model (e.g., YOLO, ResNet, VGG) or build a custom neural network.
4.	Model Training: Train the model on the dataset.
5.	Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a validation set.
6.	Prediction: Use the trained model to classify new images.
Example Using YOLO for Image Classification
Though YOLO (You Only Look Once) is primarily used for object detection, it can also be adapted for image classification tasks.
